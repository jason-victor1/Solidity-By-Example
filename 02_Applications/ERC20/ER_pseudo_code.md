### üß† Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `IERC20`

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** an interface called `IERC20`

   - Purpose: a **universal rulebook** for ERC20 tokens.
   - Any token that follows this rulebook can be understood by wallets, exchanges, and other contracts.
   - Analogy: like a **driver‚Äôs license standard** ‚Äî if everyone follows the same format, anyone can recognize and use it.

---

3. **DEFINE** a `totalSupply` function

   - **MARKED** as `external view` (just reads data).
   - **RETURNS** the total number of tokens in circulation.
   - Analogy: imagine a **central mint** that can tell you how many coins are printed in total.

---

4. **DEFINE** a `balanceOf(account)` function

   - **INPUT**: an address (someone‚Äôs wallet).
   - **RETURNS** the number of tokens that account currently holds.
   - Analogy: like asking the bank teller: _‚ÄúHow many coins are in Alice‚Äôs account?‚Äù_

---

5. **DEFINE** a `transfer(recipient, amount)` function

   - **INPUTS**: recipient‚Äôs address, amount to send.
   - **RETURNS** `true` if the transfer succeeds.
   - Analogy: you hand coins directly to another person ‚Äî like paying Bob in cash.

---

6. **DEFINE** an `allowance(owner, spender)` function

   - **INPUTS**:

     - `owner`: the person who owns tokens,
     - `spender`: someone allowed to spend on their behalf.

   - **RETURNS** how many tokens the spender is authorized to use.
   - Analogy: like checking a **pre-approved credit limit**: _‚ÄúHow much can Bob spend from Alice‚Äôs account?‚Äù_

---

7. **DEFINE** an `approve(spender, amount)` function

   - **INPUTS**: spender‚Äôs address, amount they‚Äôre allowed to spend.
   - **RETURNS** `true` if approval is recorded successfully.
   - Analogy: Alice goes to the bank and says: _‚ÄúI authorize Bob to spend up to 100 of my coins.‚Äù_

---

8. **DEFINE** a `transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount)` function

   - **INPUTS**:

     - `sender`: the original owner of tokens,
     - `recipient`: the one receiving tokens,
     - `amount`: how much to transfer.

   - **RETURNS** `true` if successful.
   - Analogy: Bob (the spender) uses Alice‚Äôs pre-approved credit to pay Carol ‚Äî the system deducts from Alice‚Äôs account and gives it to Carol.

9. **END**

‚úÖ This `IERC20` is only a **blueprint** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt hold coins itself. It‚Äôs like the **official rulebook** saying:

- How to ask for your balance,
- How to transfer tokens,
- How to grant spending permission,
- And how third parties can use that permission.
