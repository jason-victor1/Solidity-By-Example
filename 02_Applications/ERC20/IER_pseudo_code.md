### üß† Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `ERC20`

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** a contract called `ERC20`

   - It **implements the IERC20 rulebook** (so everyone in the ecosystem knows how to interact with it).
   - Analogy: like a **bank branch** that follows the official national banking protocol.

---

3. **DECLARE** state variables

   - `totalSupply`: total number of coins in circulation.

     - Analogy: the central ledger‚Äôs ‚Äútotal printed money.‚Äù

   - `balanceOf`: mapping of address ‚Üí balance.

     - Analogy: each customer‚Äôs bank account balance.

   - `allowance`: mapping of owner ‚Üí spender ‚Üí approved amount.

     - Analogy: Alice can give Bob a **card limit** on her account.

   - `name`: human-readable name of the token (e.g., ‚ÄúMyToken‚Äù).

     - Analogy: like the bank‚Äôs brand name.

   - `symbol`: ticker (e.g., ‚ÄúMTK‚Äù).

     - Analogy: stock exchange abbreviation (like VISA = ‚ÄúV‚Äù).

   - `decimals`: how divisible the token is (usually 18).

     - Analogy: how many decimal places the currency uses, like cents in a dollar.

---

4. **DECLARE** events

   - `Transfer(from, to, value)`: fires whenever tokens move.

     - Analogy: a **public announcement** that money changed hands.

   - `Approval(owner, spender, value)`: fires whenever an allowance is set.

     - Analogy: a notice posted on the wall saying, ‚ÄúAlice gave Bob a 100-coin card limit.‚Äù

---

5. **CONSTRUCTOR**

   - Runs once when the token is created.
   - Sets the `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`.
   - Analogy: printing the logo, name, and rules of your new currency.

---

6. **DEFINE** `transfer(recipient, amount)`

   - Deduct `amount` from `msg.sender`.
   - Add `amount` to `recipient`.
   - Emit `Transfer`.
   - Analogy: You hand Bob 10 coins; the ledger subtracts from you and adds to Bob. Everyone hears the announcement.

---

7. **DEFINE** `approve(spender, amount)`

   - Set spender‚Äôs allowance.
   - Emit `Approval`.
   - Analogy: Alice tells the bank clerk: ‚ÄúI authorize Bob to spend 100 coins from my account.‚Äù

---

8. **DEFINE** `transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount)`

   - Deduct `amount` from sender‚Äôs allowance to `msg.sender`.
   - Deduct `amount` from sender‚Äôs balance.
   - Add `amount` to recipient‚Äôs balance.
   - Emit `Transfer`.
   - Analogy: Bob uses Alice‚Äôs approved credit card to pay Carol. Alice‚Äôs balance goes down, Carol‚Äôs goes up, and Bob‚Äôs spending limit shrinks.

---

9. **DEFINE** `_mint(to, amount)` (internal)

   - Increase `to`‚Äôs balance.
   - Increase `totalSupply`.
   - Emit `Transfer(0x0 ‚Üí to)`.
   - Analogy: printing new money and depositing it into someone‚Äôs account. The announcement says, ‚Äúnew money appeared.‚Äù

---

10. **DEFINE** `_burn(from, amount)` (internal)

- Decrease `from`‚Äôs balance.
- Decrease `totalSupply`.
- Emit `Transfer(from ‚Üí 0x0)`.
- Analogy: taking money out of circulation and burning it ‚Äî the announcement says ‚Äúmoney destroyed.‚Äù

---

11. **DEFINE** `mint(to, amount)` (external)

- Calls `_mint` to create new tokens for `to`.
- Analogy: a central bank governor pressing the print button.

---

12. **DEFINE** `burn(from, amount)` (external)

- Calls `_burn` to destroy tokens from `from`.
- Analogy: shredding notes from someone‚Äôs account balance.

13. **END**

---

‚úÖ With this, you now have a **full ERC20 bank model**:

- `transfer`: pay directly like cash.
- `approve + transferFrom`: give someone a credit card.
- `mint`: print new money.
- `burn`: destroy money.
- `balanceOf`: check your account.
- `totalSupply`: check total money supply.
