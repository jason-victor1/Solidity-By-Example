### üß† Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `TokenSwap`

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** a contract called `TokenSwap`

   - Purpose: allow **two people to swap different ERC20 tokens safely and fairly**.
   - Analogy: like using a **barter mediator** (a neutral escrow agent).

     - Alice gives her goods to the mediator,
     - Bob gives his goods to the mediator,
     - Mediator ensures both sides get what they want ‚Äî or no trade happens at all.

---

3. **DECLARE** state variables

   - `token1`: ERC20 contract of the first token (e.g., AliceCoin).

   - `owner1`: address of the first participant (Alice).

   - `amount1`: how many tokens Alice must provide.

   - `token2`: ERC20 contract of the second token (e.g., BobCoin).

   - `owner2`: address of the second participant (Bob).

   - `amount2`: how many tokens Bob must provide.

   - Analogy: This is like writing **the swap agreement**:

     - Alice ‚Üí 10 apples,
     - Bob ‚Üí 20 oranges.

---

4. **CONSTRUCTOR** (when the contract is deployed)

   - Initializes the swap terms: which tokens, which owners, and how many tokens each owes.
   - Analogy: like a mediator writing the deal on paper before the swap starts.

---

5. **DEFINE** the `swap()` function

   - **STEP 1: Authorization**

     - Only Alice or Bob (owner1 or owner2) can trigger the swap.
     - Analogy: only the two participants can say, _‚ÄúLet‚Äôs trade now.‚Äù_

   - **STEP 2: Check Allowances**

     - Verify that both Alice and Bob have approved this contract to move their tokens.
     - Alice must have approved 10 AliceCoins.
     - Bob must have approved 20 BobCoins.
     - Analogy: both traders must hand their keys to the mediator so they can access the goods.

   - **STEP 3: Transfer Tokens**

     - Move Alice‚Äôs tokens ‚Üí Bob.
     - Move Bob‚Äôs tokens ‚Üí Alice.
     - Analogy: the mediator takes Alice‚Äôs apples, gives them to Bob, then takes Bob‚Äôs oranges and gives them to Alice ‚Äî all in one smooth exchange.

---

6. **DEFINE** helper `_safeTransferFrom(token, sender, recipient, amount)`

   - Calls `transferFrom` to move tokens from one account to another.
   - Ensures it succeeded, otherwise reverts.
   - Analogy: the mediator physically checks that the goods were delivered successfully ‚Äî if anything fails, the trade is canceled.

---

7. **TRADE FLOW EXAMPLE**

   - Alice has 100 AliceCoins, Bob has 100 BobCoins.

   - They want to swap 10 AliceCoins for 20 BobCoins.

   - Steps:

     1. Alice deploys `TokenSwap` with deal terms.
     2. Alice approves TokenSwap to move 10 AliceCoins.
     3. Bob approves TokenSwap to move 20 BobCoins.
     4. Alice (or Bob) calls `swap()`.
     5. Contract executes both transfers ‚Üí Alice now owns 20 BobCoins, Bob now owns 10 AliceCoins.

   - Analogy: A **trustless barter** ‚Äî no one can cheat because the mediator ensures both sides happen together or not at all.

---

8. **END**

---

‚úÖ **Summary with Analogy**

- `TokenSwap` = an escrow mediator for ERC20 trades.
- Constructor = write the swap deal in stone.
- Approvals = giving the mediator keys to move your goods.
- `swap()` = the mediator enforces the trade ‚Äî both sides get paid fairly.
