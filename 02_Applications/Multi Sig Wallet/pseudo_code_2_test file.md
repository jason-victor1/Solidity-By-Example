### 🧪 **Pseudocode w/ Analogies – TestContract**

1. **START**

2. **DEFINE** a contract named `TestContract`
   🧪 _Think of this as a simple test lab where we experiment with calling and encoding functions._

3. **DECLARE** a public state variable `i` of type `uint256`

   - 📈 _Represents a counter on the lab wall tracking total added values_
   - ✅ `public` allows anyone to peek in through a transparent window and see the current count

4. **DEFINE** a function `callMe(uint256 j)`

   - 🧮 _Think of this like pressing a button to increase the counter by some number `j`_
   - 🔓 Anyone can press this button, adding `j` to the lab's counter `i`

5. **DEFINE** a function `getData()` that returns encoded data

   - 🔐 This function doesn't modify state (`pure`) and simply creates a digital message
   - 📦 The message is formatted as **ABI-encoded call data** for calling the `callMe(uint256)` function with the value `123`
   - ✉️ _It’s like crafting a letter in a very specific language (ABI) saying: "Please call `callMe` and pass `123`."_

6. **END**
