 * @title AssemblyBinExp
 * @notice Fixed-point binary exponentiation `z = (x^n)` with base-scaling `b` using Yul assembly.
 * @dev
 * ðŸ§® Real-World Analogy:
 * Think of `x` as paint measured in **scaled units** (e.g., liters-per-`b`). Every time you mix two buckets
 * (a multiplication), the amount ends up in the **wrong unit**, so you must carefully **relabel** it by
 * dividing by `b`, with a small **half-scoop** added for fair rounding.
 *
 * Why binary exponentiation?
 * - Instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times, we repeatedly **square** and sometimes **attach**
 *   the squared paint to our result when the current **bit** of `n` is 1. Thatâ€™s like climbing a mountain
 *   via efficient **switchbacks** (squarings) with occasional **spurs** (conditional multiplies).
 *
 * Safety:
 * - Overflow checks after every multiply (pressure gauges).
 * - Rounding overflow checks when adding the half-scoop (spill sensors).
 * - Immediate **revert** if any safety check fails.

     * ðŸ§° Scaling & Rounding:
     * - All values are considered **scaled** by `b` (so mathematical 1 is represented as `b`).
     * - After each multiply, we re-scale by dividing by `b`.
     * - We add `half = b/2` before division to do **round half up**.
     *
     * Edge cases (handled up-front):
     * - `x == 0 && n == 0` â†’ `z = b` (i.e., 1.0 in fixed-point)
     * - `x == 0 && n > 0` â†’ `z = 0`
     * - For `x > 0`:
     *   - if `n` is even â†’ start `z = b` (neutral 1.0)
     *   - if `n` is odd  â†’ start `z = x`
     *
     * ðŸ§¯ Analogy:
     * - `b` is your **unit labeler**. Every time you mix (multiply) paint, you must re-apply the label (divide by `b`).
     * - `half = b/2` is your **half-scoop** to keep rounding fair when relabeling.
     *
     * @param x Base, in fixed-point with scale `b`. (e.g., if `b=1e18`, 1.5 is `1.5e18`)
     * @param n Exponent (non-negative integer).
     * @param b Fixed-point scale base (representation of mathematical 1).
     * @return z Result `(x^n)` in the same fixed-point scale `b`.
