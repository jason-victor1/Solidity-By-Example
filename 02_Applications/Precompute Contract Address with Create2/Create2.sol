   üß† Quick Reference (Cheat Sheet)

   CREATE2 Determinism:
   - predicted = last20( keccak256( 0xff ++ deployer ++ salt ++ keccak256(bytecode) ) )

   High-Level Path (no assembly):
   - Factory.deploy(owner, foo, salt) ‚Üí new TestContract{salt: salt}(owner, foo)

   Low-Level Path (assembly):
   - bytecode = FactoryAssembly.getBytecode(owner, foo)
   - predicted = FactoryAssembly.getAddress(bytecode, salt)
   - FactoryAssembly.deploy(bytecode, salt) ‚Üí emits Deployed(addr, salt)
   - addr == predicted (if same inputs)

   Analogies:
   - Factory = **vending machine**, CREATE2 = **deterministic lockers**,
   - salt = **token** deciding the locker slot,
   - bytecode+args = **recipe card** describing the safe,
   - getAddress = **locker map** you can check ahead of time,
   - TestContract = the **safe** (owner name + model number), can hold **cash**.
