### ðŸ§  Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `StorageSlot` & `TestSlot`

---

1. **START**

2. **DEFINE** a library called `StorageSlot`

   - This library gives us tools to directly access **specific memory drawers** (storage slots).
   - Analogy: Think of Ethereum storage like a **giant filing cabinet**. Each drawer has a unique label (`bytes32 slot`). This library gives us a way to open a drawer and put an object (address) inside.

3. **DECLARE** a struct `AddressSlot`

   - Holds a single value: an `address`.
   - Analogy: Itâ€™s like a **folder** that can only store one contact card (address).

4. **DEFINE** a function `getAddressSlot(slot)` inside `StorageSlot`

   - Input: a unique label (`bytes32 slot`).
   - Returns: a pointer to the storage drawer (`AddressSlot`) at that label.
   - Internally uses `assembly` to point directly at the slot.
   - Analogy: You hand it the drawerâ€™s label, and it gives you the **handle** to open that exact drawer.

---

5. **DEFINE** a contract `TestSlot`

   - Uses the `StorageSlot` library to demonstrate writing and reading data.
   - Analogy: This is like a **demo office** that lets you put an address into a special drawer and retrieve it later.

6. **DECLARE** a constant `TEST_SLOT`

   - Value: `keccak256("TEST_SLOT")`.
   - This ensures a unique drawer label so it doesnâ€™t collide with others.
   - Analogy: Like stamping a **unique barcode** on a filing cabinet drawer.

---

7. **DEFINE** a function `write(_addr)`

   - Finds the drawer using `StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(TEST_SLOT)`.
   - Stores the `_addr` inside it.
   - Analogy: You open the drawer labeled `TEST_SLOT` and put in a **business card** with `_addr`.

---

8. **DEFINE** a function `get()`

   - Finds the same drawer (`TEST_SLOT`) and retrieves the stored address.
   - Analogy: Open the drawer and pull out the **contact card** that was stored earlier.

---

9. **END**

---

ðŸ”‘ **Real-World Summary**:

- `StorageSlot` = **toolbox** for safely opening specific drawers in Ethereumâ€™s filing cabinet.
- `AddressSlot` = **folder** holding one address.
- `TestSlot.write()` = put an address into the special drawer.
- `TestSlot.get()` = pull the address back out.
