### ðŸ§  Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `MerkleProof` + `TestMerkleProof`

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** a digital system called `MerkleProof`

   - Purpose: verify if a transaction (leaf) belongs to a bigger "family tree" of transactions (Merkle tree).
   - Analogy: imagine a **notarized family tree of receipts** where each receipt must prove its ancestry.

---

3. **DEFINE** a `verify` function

   - **INPUTS**:

     - `proof`: list of sibling hashes (needed to climb the family tree)
     - `root`: the final ancestor hash at the very top of the tree
     - `leaf`: the hash of the transaction/receipt we want to prove
     - `index`: the position of the leaf in the tree (left/right order matters)

   - **PROCESS**:

     1. Start with the `leaf` (your personal receipt).
     2. For each proof element:

        - If you are the **left child** (index is even), combine yourself first then your sibling.
        - If you are the **right child** (index is odd), combine your sibling first then yourself.
        - Hash the pair to move one level up in the tree.
        - Update index = index / 2 (go up one level).

     3. Repeat until you reach the root.

   - **RETURN**: `true` if final computed hash == `root`, otherwise `false`.

   - Analogy: step-by-step, you show your sibling receipts and climb up the family tree until you reach the notarized ancestor. If your final ancestor matches the official one â†’ proof valid âœ….

4. **DEFINE** another contract `TestMerkleProof`

   - Purpose: build a small Merkle tree from 4 sample transactions to test verification.

---

5. **DECLARE** an array `hashes`

   - Holds all hashes:

     - Leaf hashes (receipts),
     - Parent hashes,
     - The root at the end.

---

6. **CONSTRUCTOR**

   - Create 4 transactions: `"alice -> bob"`, `"bob -> dave"`, `"carol -> alice"`, `"dave -> bob"`.

   - Hash each transaction (like stamping receipts).

   - Iteratively combine pairs:

     - Hash(left + right) â†’ parent.
     - Keep repeating until only one ancestor remains.

   - Store all intermediate and final results in `hashes`.

   - Analogy: like building a **pyramid of receipts**, where each higher level is a summary of two below.

---

7. **DEFINE** a `getRoot` function

   - **RETURN** the last element in `hashes` (the Merkle root).
   - Analogy: this is the **great-grandparent signature** proving the ancestry of all receipts.

---

8. **EXAMPLE** (from comments in code)

   - Want to verify `"carol -> alice"` (3rd receipt):

     - Provide its `leaf` hash,
     - Provide its sibling proof list,
     - Provide its index (2),
     - Run `verify(proof, root, leaf, index)` â†’ returns `true` âœ….

   - Analogy: Carol shows her receipt and sibling receipts, walks up the family tree, and proves she belongs to the official notarized tree.
