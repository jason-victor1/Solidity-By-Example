### 🧠 Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `ERC20` (Solmate) + `ERC20Permit`

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** an abstract contract `ERC20` (modern, gas-efficient)

   - Purpose: standard token accounts, transfers, allowances **plus** gasless approvals via `permit` (EIP-2612).
   - Analogy: a **bank core** that:

     - tracks balances and total money printed,
     - supports direct payments and “debit card” spending with limits,
     - accepts **signed letters** to set card limits without visiting the bank.

---

3. **DECLARE** events

   - `Transfer(from, to, amount)`

     - Analogy: **loudspeaker**: “X coins moved from Alice to Bob.”

   - `Approval(owner, spender, amount)`

     - Analogy: **posted notice**: “Alice sets Bob’s card limit to N.”

---

4. **DECLARE** state variables

   - `name`, `symbol`, `decimals (immutable)`

     - Analogy: the currency branding and small-unit precision (like cents).

   - `totalSupply`

     - Analogy: **total printed money** in circulation.

   - `balanceOf[address]`

     - Analogy: each customer’s **account balance**.

   - `allowance[owner][spender]`

     - Analogy: **card limit** the owner gives to a spender.

   - `INITIAL_CHAIN_ID` and `INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR (immutable)`

     - Analogy: the **notary seal** describing the bank’s chain & identity when it opened.

   - `nonces[owner]`

     - Analogy: a **serial number counter** on owner’s signed letters—prevents reusing the same letter twice.

---

5. **CONSTRUCTOR** `(name, symbol, decimals)`

   - Set brand/decimals.
   - Record `INITIAL_CHAIN_ID = current chain id`.
   - Compute and store `INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`.
   - Analogy: at grand opening, the bank prints its **official seal** (domain separator) with name/version/chain/address.

---

6. **DEFINE** `approve(spender, amount) -> bool`

   - Set `allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount`.
   - `emit Approval`.
   - Analogy: **in-person** at the bank: “Set Bob’s card limit to N.”

---

7. **DEFINE** `transfer(to, amount) -> bool`

   - Subtract from caller’s balance; add to `to`.
   - `emit Transfer`.
   - Analogy: hand cash to Bob; the teller debits you and credits Bob.

---

8. **DEFINE** `transferFrom(from, to, amount) -> bool`

   - Read `allowed = allowance[from][msg.sender]`.
   - If `allowed != type(uint256).max`, reduce it by `amount` (unlimited approvals stay untouched).
   - Move balances; `emit Transfer`.
   - Analogy: using the **debit card**: the bank decreases the card limit unless it’s an **infinite card**; always move funds from the card holder to the payee.

---

9. **DEFINE** `permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s)`

   - **CHECK**: `deadline >= now` (valid letter must not be expired).
   - **BUILD** the EIP-712 typed data hash:

     - Prefix `\x19\x01`,
     - `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`,
     - Hash of `Permit(owner,spender,value,nonce,deadline)` using the **current `nonces[owner]`** (then increment).

   - **RECOVER** signer via `ecrecover(...)` with `(v,r,s)`.
   - **CHECK**: recovered address is non-zero and equals `owner`.
   - **EFFECT**: set `allowance[owner][spender] = value`; `emit Approval`.
   - Analogy: a **handwritten, numbered letter** (nonce) with the bank’s official seal (domain) and expiry (deadline). The clerk verifies the signature and date, stamps it, and updates the card limit—no in-person visit needed.

---

10. **DEFINE** `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() -> bytes32`

- If current `chainid == INITIAL_CHAIN_ID`, return `INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`.
- Else recompute with `computeDomainSeparator()`.
- Analogy: if the bank changes jurisdictions (chain id), it **reissues the notary seal** dynamically so letters can’t be replayed across chains.

---

11. **DEFINE** `computeDomainSeparator() -> bytes32`

- EIP-712 domain hash with:

  - name, version `"1"`, chainId, verifyingContract (this address).

- Analogy: the **notary’s stamp** encoding who we are, where we are, and which ledger this is.

---

12. **DEFINE** internal supply ops

- `_mint(to, amount)`

  - Increase `totalSupply`, add to `to`, `emit Transfer(0→to)`.
  - Analogy: **print new money** and deposit it into an account.

- `_burn(from, amount)`

  - Subtract from `from`, then decrease `totalSupply`, `emit Transfer(from→0)`.
  - Analogy: **shred money** from an account and reduce the overall supply.

---

13. **DEFINE** contract `ERC20Permit` (concrete)

- Inherits `ERC20`; constructor passes brand/decimals upstream.
- Exposes `mint(to, amount)` calling `_mint`.
- Analogy: a small **public branch** on top of the core bank that lets anyone (demo) print notes—(in production, you’d restrict this).

---

14. **END**

### 🔎 Quick Reference (Cheat Sheet)

- **Balances & Supply:**

  - `balanceOf[a]` = account balance; `totalSupply` = printed money.

- **Payments & Cards:**

  - `transfer(to, amt)` = direct payment.
  - `approve(spender, amt)` = set card limit.
  - `transferFrom(from, to, amt)` = spend via card; infinite card (`type(uint256).max`) skips decrement.

- **Gasless Approval (EIP-2612):**

  - `permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v,r,s)`

    - Uses `nonces[owner]` (auto-increments) to prevent replay.
    - Uses `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` to bind signature to chain + contract.
    - Sets allowance **without** an on-chain `approve` call from the owner.

- **Domain & Replay Safety:**

  - `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` re-seals if chain id changes.
  - `deadline` prevents old letters being used after expiry.
  - `nonces` ensure each letter is **one-time use**.

- **Supply Ops:**

  - `_mint` prints; `_burn` shreds (emit `Transfer` with zero address to signal mint/burn).

---

### 🧯 Practical Notes

- **Production:** gate `mint`/`burn` with access control.
- **Frontends:** sign EIP-712 typed data for `permit` (domain/name/version/chain/contract).
- **Relayers:** can combine `permit` + `transferFrom` to offer **gasless** UX paid in tokens.
