### üß† Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `MultiCall` + `TestMultiCall`

---

1. **START**

2. **DEFINE** contract `MultiCall`

   - Purpose: **bundle multiple read-only calls** into a single request and return all their results.
   - Analogy: a **concierge** who makes several quick **phone inquiries** for you and brings back each answer in order.

3. **FUNCTION** `multiCall(targets[], data[]) -> results[]` (**external view**)

   - **INPUTS**

     - `targets[]`: list of contract addresses to call.
     - `data[]`: list of ABI-encoded call payloads (what function + params to call for each target).

   - **GUARD**

     - Ensure `targets.length == data.length`.
     - Analogy: you have a **call sheet** where every phone number (target) must have a **matching script** (data). If counts don‚Äôt match, you stop before dialing.

   - **ALLOCATE** `results` as an array of `bytes` with same length as `data`.

     - Analogy: prepare **labeled inbox trays** to file each call‚Äôs response in the correct order.

   - **LOOP** over `i` from `0` to `targets.length - 1`:

     - **DO** a `staticcall` to `targets[i]` with `data[i]`.

       - `staticcall` means **read-only**: no state changes allowed.
       - Analogy: you‚Äôre **asking questions only**, not signing any documents‚Äîpure info gathering.

     - **REQUIRE** `success == true`, else revert `"call failed"`.

       - Analogy: if any phone inquiry **fails**, you stop the whole errand and report the failure.

     - **STORE** `result` bytes into `results[i]`.

       - Analogy: file the caller‚Äôs **answer transcript** in the ith tray.

   - **RETURN** `results` (bytes\[]):

     - Analogy: the concierge comes back with a **bundle of answers**, each in the same order as requested.

4. **RESULT FORMAT** (`bytes[]`)

   - Each element corresponds to the **ABI-encoded return data** of that call (could be decoded by the caller).
   - Analogy: each transcript is in **shorthand**; you (the client) decode it to read the exact numbers/strings.

---

5. **DEFINE** contract `TestMultiCall`

   - Purpose: a tiny helper to demonstrate how to **prepare call data** and a simple target function to call.
   - Analogy: a **practice receptionist** with a simple Q\&A line and a **script factory** for making the questions.

6. **FUNCTION** `test(_i) -> uint256` (**external pure**)

   - **RETURN** `_i` unchanged.
   - Analogy: like calling a hotline that just **echoes the number** you say back to you (useful to test the wiring).

7. **FUNCTION** `getData(_i) -> bytes` (**external pure**)

   - **CREATE** ABI-encoded payload for calling `this.test(_i)` using `abi.encodeWithSelector(this.test.selector, _i)`.
   - **RETURN** the encoded bytes.
   - Analogy: this is a **question script builder**:

     - `selector` = the **button code** on the phone menu (which function to reach).
     - `_i` = the **argument** you want to pass along.
     - Output = a **ready-to-dial script** you hand to the concierge.

---

8. **USAGE FLOW (Story Mode)**

   - You want to query multiple contracts (or the same contract multiple times) in **one shot**:

     1. For each intended call, **build the payload** (e.g., with `getData(x)` or manual `abi.encodeWithSelector(...)`).
     2. Put **all target addresses** into `targets[]` and **matching payloads** into `data[]` at the **same indices**.
     3. Call `MultiCall.multiCall(targets, data)`.
     4. Receive `results[]` (each `bytes`) and **decode** them client-side (e.g., with `abi.decode` in off-chain tooling or another contract).

   - Analogy: you prepare a **list of phone numbers** and a **script for each**; the concierge makes all the calls and hands you a **stack of transcripts**‚Äîone per call, in order.

---

9. **WHY `staticcall`?**

   - Guarantees **no state changes**‚Äîsafer for batching reads.
   - Analogy: ‚ÄúJust asking questions,‚Äù not committing to anything; the receptionist can‚Äôt accidentally **change records**.

10. **ERROR BEHAVIOR**

- If **any** call fails, the **entire multi-call reverts**.
- Analogy: if one of the phone numbers **disconnects**, the concierge **aborts the errand** and tells you it failed (atomicity).

11. **GAS & EFFICIENCY NOTES**

- One on-chain entry point, multiple internal calls ‚Üí **fewer transactions**.
- Still pays for each sub-call, but **saves overhead** compared to many separate transactions.
- Analogy: one concierge trip versus you running around the city making each call yourself.
