### 🧠 Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `ERC1155` (Multi-Token Standard)

---

1. **START**

---

2. **DEFINE** interface `IERC1155`

   * Purpose: The **rulebook for a warehouse** that stores many kinds of items (multiple token IDs), and each item can have **many copies**.

   * Key operations:

     * `safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, value, data)` – ship **one item type**.
     * `safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, values, data)` – ship **many item types** in one truck.
     * `balanceOf(owner, id)` – how many copies of item `id` a wallet holds.
     * `balanceOfBatch(owners, ids)` – ask many “how-many” questions in one shot.
     * `setApprovalForAll(operator, approved)` – hire/fire a **warehouse manager** to move **all** your items.
     * `isApprovedForAll(owner, operator)` – check if a manager is currently authorized.

   * **Analogy:**

     * Each `id` = a product SKU in the warehouse.
     * `value` = quantity of that SKU.
     * Approvals = a signed work order giving a manager permission to handle all your SKUs.

---

3. **DEFINE** interface `IERC1155TokenReceiver`

   * Purpose: Contracts that receive ERC1155 deliveries must **sign the delivery slip**.

   * Hooks:

     * `onERC1155Received(...)` – confirms receipt for a **single-SKU** delivery.
     * `onERC1155BatchReceived(...)` – confirms receipt for a **multi-SKU** delivery.

   * **Analogy:**

     * If the destination is a warehouse (a contract), the courier won’t leave pallets unless someone signs the slip with the exact code.

---

4. **DEFINE** contract `ERC1155` (implements `IERC1155`)

   * **Events (warehouse loudspeaker):**

     * `TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, value)` – one SKU moved.
     * `TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, values)` – multiple SKUs moved.
     * `ApprovalForAll(owner, operator, approved)` – manager hired/fired.
     * `URI(value, id)` – metadata link for a SKU (like a product page).

   * **Storage (warehouse ledgers):**

     * `balanceOf[owner][id]` – how many units of SKU `id` the owner has.
     * `isApprovedForAll[owner][operator]` – whether a manager can move items on the owner’s behalf.

   * **FUNCTION** `balanceOfBatch(owners, ids) -> balances`

     * **CHECK**: arrays are same length.
     * **FOR EACH i**: `balances[i] = balanceOf[owners[i]][ids[i]]`.
     * **Analogy:** a quick **inventory report** answering many “how many of SKU X at location Y?” questions at once.

   * **FUNCTION** `setApprovalForAll(operator, approved)`

     * Toggle manager rights; emit `ApprovalForAll`.
     * **Analogy:** sign a standing contract with a logistics company to handle **all** your SKUs.

   * **FUNCTION** `safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, value, data)`

     * **CHECKS:**

       * Caller is `from` **or** an approved manager.
       * `to` is not the zero address.
     * **EFFECTS:** subtract from `from`, add to `to`, emit `TransferSingle`.
     * **If `to` is a contract**: call `onERC1155Received` and require the correct receipt code.
     * **Analogy:** ship a **single product SKU**. If the destination is a warehouse, it must sign the delivery slip or the courier leaves with the goods.

   * **FUNCTION** `safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, values, data)`

     * **CHECKS:** caller authorized; `to` not zero; arrays same length.
     * **EFFECTS:** loop over pairs, subtract/add balances, emit `TransferBatch`.
     * **If `to` is a contract**: call `onERC1155BatchReceived` and require the receipt code.
     * **Analogy:** send a **truck with many SKUs**; the receiving warehouse signs for all pallets in one go.

   * **FUNCTION** `supportsInterface(interfaceId) -> bool`

     * Claims support for ERC165, ERC1155, and ERC1155MetadataURI interfaces.
     * **Analogy:** the warehouse displays badges for the standards it speaks.

   * **FUNCTION** `uri(id) -> string` (virtual)

     * Metadata endpoint per SKU (e.g., JSON with name, image).
     * **Analogy:** product page URL.

   * **INTERNAL** `_mint(to, id, value, data)`

     * **CHECKS:** `to` not zero.
     * **EFFECTS:** increase `balanceOf[to][id]`; emit `TransferSingle(0→to)`; require receipt if `to` is contract.
     * **Analogy:** **manufacture** `value` new units of SKU `id` and deliver them to `to`.

   * **INTERNAL** `_batchMint(to, ids, values, data)`

     * **CHECKS:** `to` not zero; arrays same length.
     * **EFFECTS:** for each SKU, add balances; emit `TransferBatch(0→to)`; require batch receipt if `to` is contract.
     * **Analogy:** produce **multiple SKUs** and stock them at `to` in one shipment.

   * **INTERNAL** `_burn(from, id, value)`

     * **CHECK:** `from` not zero.
     * **EFFECTS:** deduct balance, emit `TransferSingle(from→0)`.
     * **Analogy:** **destroy** `value` units of SKU `id` from `from`’s shelf.

   * **INTERNAL** `_batchBurn(from, ids, values)`

     * **CHECKS:** `from` not zero; arrays same length.
     * **EFFECTS:** deduct per SKU; emit `TransferBatch(from→0)`.
     * **Analogy:** bulk destruction of many SKUs at once.

---

5. **DEFINE** contract `MyMultiToken` (extends `ERC1155`)

   * **FUNCTION** `mint(id, value, data)`

     * Calls `_mint(msg.sender, id, value, data)`.
     * **Analogy:** user manufactures more units of SKU `id` into their own shelf.

   * **FUNCTION** `batchMint(ids, values, data)`

     * Calls `_batchMint(msg.sender, ids, values, data)`.
     * **Analogy:** user manufactures **several SKUs** and stocks themselves in one operation.

   * **FUNCTION** `burn(id, value)`

     * Calls `_burn(msg.sender, id, value)`.
     * **Analogy:** user discards a quantity of SKU `id` from their shelf.

   * **FUNCTION** `batchBurn(ids, values)`

     * Calls `_batchBurn(msg.sender, ids, values)`.
     * **Analogy:** user discards multiple SKUs in bulk.

---

6. **TYPICAL FLOW (Story Time)**

   * **Setup:**

     * Alice holds various SKUs (ids 1, 2, 3 with different quantities).
     * Alice hires Bob as her **operator**: `setApprovalForAll(Bob, true)`.

   * **Single Transfer:**

     * Bob (operator) calls `safeTransferFrom(Alice, Carol, id=2, value=50, data=...)`.
     * Warehouse subtracts 50 of SKU #2 from Alice, adds 50 to Carol, and if Carol is a contract, demands the signed receipt.

   * **Batch Transfer:**

     * Bob calls `safeBatchTransferFrom(Alice, Dave, ids=[1,3], values=[10,5], data=...)`.
     * The truck carries SKU #1 (10 units) and SKU #3 (5 units). Dave’s warehouse signs once for everything.

   * **Mint/Burn:**

     * Alice mints 100 units of SKU #7 to herself. Later she burns 20 units she no longer needs.

### 🔎 Quick Reference (Cheat Sheet)

* **Balances:**

  * `balanceOf(owner, id)` → units of SKU `id` on `owner`’s shelf
  * `balanceOfBatch([...owners], [...ids])` → bulk balance report

* **Approvals:**

  * `setApprovalForAll(operator, true/false)` → hire/fire a warehouse manager
  * `isApprovedForAll(owner, operator)` → check manager status

* **Transfers:**

  * `safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, value, data)` → ship one SKU
  * `safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, values, data)` → ship many SKUs at once
  * Safe because destination contracts must sign (`onERC1155Received/BatchReceived`)

* **Supply Changes (internal):**

  * `_mint`, `_batchMint` → manufacture new units
  * `_burn`, `_batchBurn` → destroy units

* **Metadata & Introspection:**

  * `uri(id)` → product page template per SKU
  * `supportsInterface` → badges for ERC165/1155/metadata

**Analogy Recap:**

* ERC1155 = **one warehouse** storing **many product types**, each with **quantities**.
* Batch ops = **one truck** moving **many pallets** (multiple SKUs) in a single visit.
* Approvals = **standing contracts** with logistics managers.
* Safe transfers = **no drop-offs** at warehouses that don’t sign the receipt.
