 * - **claimed[leaf]** = the **hand stamp** preventing you from redeeming twice.
 * - **token.mint(to, amount)** = the **ticket printer** dispensing your tickets once verified.
 *
 * Security & UX Notes:
 * - Leaf uniqueness: each `(to, amount)` pair must appear **at most once** in the tree
 *   (duplicate entries would share the same leaf hash and would be blocked by `claimed`).
 * - Off-chain list construction determines distribution; this contract only verifies and dispenses.
