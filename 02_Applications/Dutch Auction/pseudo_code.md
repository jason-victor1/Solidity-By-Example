# üß† Pseudo Code with Real-World Analogies: `DutchAuction`

---

1. **START**

2. **DEFINE** an interface `IERC721`

   - Contains `transferFrom` to move the NFT.
   - üñºÔ∏è Analogy: A certificate of ownership transfer for a painting.

---

3. **DEFINE** a contract `DutchAuction`

   - This is the **auction house** using a Dutch auction method.
   - üïí Analogy: Instead of raising bids, the price starts **high** and gradually **falls over time** until someone buys.

---

4. **DECLARE CONSTANT** `DURATION = 7 days`

   - Auction lasts exactly 7 days.
   - ‚è≥ Analogy: The auctioneer runs a countdown clock for one week.

---

5. **STATE VARIABLES**

   - `nft`: The NFT being sold.
   - `nftId`: The ID of the NFT.
   - `seller`: The owner of the NFT.
   - `startingPrice`: Price at which auction begins.
   - `startAt`: When the auction begins (block timestamp).
   - `expiresAt`: When the auction ends (start + 7 days).
   - `discountRate`: How much the price drops every second.

   üõçÔ∏è Analogy:

   - The seller puts a painting in the gallery.
   - They set a **starting price**, a **daily discount rate**, and a **deadline** when the painting is no longer for sale.

---

6. **CONSTRUCTOR**

   - **SET** seller to the contract deployer.
   - **STORE** NFT details and auction parameters.
   - **CHECK** that starting price is not too low (must cover total discounts over 7 days).

   üé® Analogy: The seller places the painting in the gallery, sets the opening price, and defines how quickly the price drops each day until it either sells or the week ends.

---

7. **FUNCTION getPrice()**

   - **CALCULATE** how much time has passed since the auction started.
   - **COMPUTE** the discount as `timeElapsed * discountRate`.
   - **RETURN** `startingPrice - discount`.

   üí∏ Analogy: The auctioneer reduces the price every second according to the discount rate, just like marking down a price tag slowly over time.

---

8. **FUNCTION buy()**

   - **REQUIRE** auction is still running (before `expiresAt`).
   - **CALCULATE** the current price using `getPrice()`.
   - **CHECK** that buyer sends enough ETH.
   - **TRANSFER** the NFT from seller to buyer.
   - **REFUND** any excess ETH sent.
   - **SELF-DESTRUCT** contract and send all remaining ETH to seller.

   üõí Analogy:

   - A buyer walks into the gallery, sees the **current reduced price**, and decides to purchase.
   - If they hand over too much cash, the gallery returns the change.
   - Once sold, the auction ends permanently (contract destroyed), and the seller pockets the proceeds.

9. **END**
