1. 🏗️ START building a small digital building (smart contract)

2. 🏷️ Put a name on the building:
   DEFINE a contract named "HelloWorld"
   // Imagine this like naming a shop or office—everyone will refer to it by this title.

3. 🗄️ DECLARE a signboard inside the building (a stored variable on the blockchain):
   a. "greet" – a public message board (string) that anyone can read
   b. Initialize it to say "Hello World!"
   // Like a welcome sign you hang at the entrance: always visible to everyone visiting the building.

4. 🏁 END the contract setup.
