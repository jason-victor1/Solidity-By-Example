1. 🏗️ START setting up a high-speed warehouse where items on a shelf (array) are managed for efficiency.

2. 🏷️ DEFINE a contract named "ArrayReplaceFromEnd"
   // This setup skips slow shifting—just grab the last box and use it to fill the gap.

   a. 📦 DECLARE a dynamic array "arr" to store boxes with numbers (uint256).

   b. 🧠 DEFINE a function "remove":
   i. 📥 Accept a position "index" where a box should be removed.
   ii. 🔁 OVERWRITE the box at "index" with the box from the end (`arr[arr.length - 1]`)
   // Like saying: "Instead of sliding everything, just swap in the last box."
   iii. 🧹 Call `pop()` to remove the last (now duplicate) box and shorten the shelf.
   // You’ve already reused its value—now throw away the extra.

   c. 🧪 DEFINE a function "test":
   i. 🧰 Fill "arr" with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   // A row of boxes labeled 1 to 4.

   ii. ❌ CALL `remove(1)` to remove the box at index 1: - 📦 Replace index 1 (value 2) with the last box (value 4), shelf becomes `[1, 4, 3, 4]`, then trim to `[1, 4, 3]` - ✅ ASSERT: - arr.length == 3 - arr[0] == 1 - arr[1] == 4 - arr[2] == 3

   iii. ❌ CALL `remove(2)` on the updated array `[1, 4, 3]`: - 📦 Replace index 2 (value 3) with the last box (also 3), then trim → shelf becomes `[1, 4]` - ✅ ASSERT: - arr.length == 2 - arr[0] == 1 - arr[1] == 4

3. 🏁 END of the efficient shelf replacement logic.
