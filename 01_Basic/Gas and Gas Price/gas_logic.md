// 🚖 Ethereum Gas System Explained with a Taxi Analogy

// 🧾 Transaction = You (the passenger)
// You are trying to get your transaction processed and added to the blockchain.
// Just like catching a taxi to get somewhere.

// 🛻 Block = Taxi
// The block is like the taxi that carries transactions (passengers).
// But it can only fit so many people at once — determined by the block gas limit.

// 💨 Gas Spent = Distance Traveled
// Every transaction requires some computation, just like every taxi ride covers distance.
// The more complex your transaction, the farther the "taxi" has to drive (more gas is spent).

// 💰 Gas Price = Fare per Mile
// You get to set how much you're willing to pay per unit of gas (like setting your fare per mile).
// The higher your bid (gas price), the more likely a miner/validator (taxi driver) is to accept your transaction quickly.

// 🧯 Gas Limit = Your Budget Cap
// Before starting the ride, you tell the taxi: “I’m only willing to spend $100 max”.
// This is your gas limit — the upper cap of how much gas your transaction can consume.
// If the ride costs less, you’re refunded the difference.
// If it exceeds your budget, the ride fails — but you still pay for what was attempted.

// ⛽ Block Gas Limit = Taxi’s Fuel Tank Capacity
// The taxi can only go so far on a full tank — just like a block can only process a certain amount of gas total.
// That means only a limited number of transactions can fit into a single block.
// If too many passengers (transactions) are competing, the ones paying more per mile (higher gas price) get priority.

// 👨‍✈️ Miner/Validator = Taxi Driver
// The miner/validator selects transactions that offer the highest gas prices to maximize profit.
// Just like a taxi driver picks passengers who offer better fares first.

// ✅ Summary:
// - Transaction = You
// - Block = Taxi
// - Gas Spent = Distance traveled
// - Gas Price = Fare per mile
// - Gas Limit = Your max budget
// - Block Gas Limit = Taxi’s fuel tank (how many rides it can handle)
// - Miner = Taxi driver choosing the best-paying passengers

// 📝 This analogy helps make Ethereum's gas model easier to understand —
// it’s all about computation as a service, paid for like a ride!
