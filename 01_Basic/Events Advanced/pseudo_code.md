1. 🏁 START — This system simulates an event-driven notification platform where:
   - Users send packages (transfers)
   - System emits alerts (events)
   - Others can subscribe and react to these alerts

---

🧭 DEFINE contract "EventDrivenArchitecture"
a. DEFINE event "TransferInitiated": - 🔔 Notifies when a transfer has started (who sends, who receives, how much)

b. DEFINE event "TransferConfirmed": - ✅ Notifies when a transfer is confirmed and finalized

c. DECLARE mapping "transferConfirmations" from transferId (bytes32) → bool - 📦 Keeps a checklist to avoid confirming the same transfer twice

d. DEFINE function "initiateTransfer(to, value)" - EMIT event TransferInitiated with sender, recipient, and amount - (Simulates starting a transfer process)

e. DEFINE function "confirmTransfer(transferId)" - IF transferId has not been confirmed:
i. ✅ Mark it as confirmed
ii. EMIT event TransferConfirmed with sender and system address
iii. (Simulates confirming the delivery)

---

📡 DEFINE interface "IEventSubscriber"
a. DECLARE function "handleTransferEvent(from, to, value)" - 🔔 Lets a subscriber react when a transfer is emitted

---

📢 DEFINE contract "EventSubscription"
a. DEFINE event "LogTransfer": - 🔔 Announces a new transfer has been triggered

b. DECLARE mapping "subscribers" from address → bool - 📋 Who is subscribed to receive alerts

c. DECLARE array "subscriberList" - 📦 A list of all people who subscribed

d. DEFINE function "subscribe()" - IF caller is not already subscribed:
i. ✅ Add to mapping and list

e. DEFINE function "unsubscribe()" - IF caller is subscribed:
i. ❌ Remove from mapping
ii. 🧹 Remove from list by replacing and popping the last entry

f. DEFINE function "transfer(to, value)" - EMIT "LogTransfer" event with sender and recipient - 🔁 Loop through all subscribers:
i. CALL their `handleTransferEvent` function with transfer details
ii. (Simulates pushing real-time update to clients)

---

🏁 END — The platform handles:

- Emitting real-time alerts
- Managing dynamic subscriber lists
- Enabling reactive systems to act on events
