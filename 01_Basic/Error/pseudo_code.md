1. START

2. DEFINE a contract named `Error`

3. DEFINE a function `testRequire`
   a. MARK function as public and pure
   b. ACCEPT an unsigned integer parameter `_i`
   c. CHECK if `_i` is greater than 10
      i. IF NOT, REVERT execution with the error message: `"Input must be greater than 10"`

4. DEFINE a function `testRevert`
   a. MARK function as public and pure
   b. ACCEPT an unsigned integer parameter `_i`
   c. CHECK if `_i` is less than or equal to 10
      i. IF TRUE, REVERT execution with the error message: `"Input must be greater than 10"`

5. DECLARE a public unsigned integer variable `num` initialized to 0 (default)

6. DEFINE a function `testAssert`
   a. MARK function as public and view
   b. CHECK if `num` is equal to 0
      i. IF NOT, HALT execution using `assert` (indicates an internal error or invariant breach)

7. DEFINE a custom error `InsufficientBalance`
   a. INCLUDE parameters:
      i. `balance` (unsigned integer): The current contract balance
      ii. `withdrawAmount` (unsigned integer): The requested withdrawal amount

8. DEFINE a function `testCustomError`
   a. MARK function as public and view
   b. ACCEPT an unsigned integer parameter `_withdrawAmount`
   c. GET the current contract balance as `bal`
   d. CHECK if `bal` is less than `_withdrawAmount`
      i. IF TRUE, REVERT execution with the custom error `InsufficientBalance` and parameters:
         - `balance`: Current contract balance (`bal`)
         - `withdrawAmount`: Requested withdrawal amount (`_withdrawAmount`)
