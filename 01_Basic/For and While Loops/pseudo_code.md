    1.  🏗️ START setting up a digital workshop (smart contract) where robots follow looped instructions.

1.  🏷️ Name the facility:
    DEFINE a contract called "Loop"
    // Think of it as a warehouse where machines run loops to process tasks step-by-step.

    a. 🛠️ DEFINE a function named "loop", marked as public and pure
    // This is a simulation function—it doesn’t change anything permanently, just demonstrates logic.

    i. 🔁 FOR LOOP: - 🏁 INITIALIZE a worker index `i = 0` - 🚶 CONDITION: Keep looping while `i < 10` (like 10 shifts) - ⏫ INCREMENT: After each task, move to the next worker (`i++`)

          - 🔎 Inside the loop:
            - IF `i == 3`:
              - ⏭️ Skip this worker’s shift using `continue`
                // Like saying, "Skip worker #3—they’re on break, move to the next."

            - IF `i == 5`:
              - 🛑 Use `break` to shut down the whole loop
                // Like saying, "Stop the operation if we reach worker #5—emergency exit."

    ii. 🔁 WHILE LOOP: - 🏁 INITIALIZE a counter `j = 0` - 🔁 CONDITION: Keep working while `j < 10` - ⏫ INCREMENT: After each pass, increase `j` by 1
    // Like a machine doing 10 tasks, counting as it goes.

2.  🏁 END loop simulation setup.
