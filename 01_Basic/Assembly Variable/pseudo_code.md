### Pseudocode with Analogies

1. **START**

2. **DEFINE** a contract named `AssemblyVariable`
   ðŸ’¡ _Think of this as a specialized toolbox for performing low-level tasks using Yul (Ethereum's assembly language)._

3. **DEFINE** a function `yul_let`
   a. MARK function as `public` and `pure`
   ðŸ’¡ _This is like a calculator function that works without touching or reading the blockchain's stored memory â€” it only does math internally._
   b. RETURNS a `uint256` named `z`
   ðŸ’¡ _This is like a return receipt from the function showing the computed result._

4. **WITHIN** the function, OPEN an `assembly` block
   ðŸ’¡ _This is like switching from regular English to a secret technical shorthand (Yul) for efficiency and finer control._

5. **DECLARE** a local variable `x` using `let` and assign it the value `123`
   ðŸ’¡ _Imagine youâ€™re writing a number `123` on a sticky note called `x`. This value exists only temporarily during this function call._

6. **SET** the output variable `z` to the value `456`
   ðŸ’¡ _Youâ€™re filling in the official result form with the number `456` to be returned at the end._

7. **END** function `yul_let`

8. **END** contract `AssemblyVariable`
   ðŸ’¡ _Your low-level math trick is complete and sealed inside this special toolbox._
