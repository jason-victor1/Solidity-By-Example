### ðŸ§  Pseudocode: Binary Search for Most Significant Bit (MSB)

```
Define contract MostSignificantBitFunction:

    Function mostSignificantBit(x):
        Initialize variable msb to 0

        # Check if x is at least 2^128
        IF x â‰¥ 2^128:
            Right-shift x by 128 bits
            Add 128 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^64
        IF x â‰¥ 2^64:
            Right-shift x by 64 bits
            Add 64 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^32
        IF x â‰¥ 2^32:
            Right-shift x by 32 bits
            Add 32 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^16
        IF x â‰¥ 2^16:
            Right-shift x by 16 bits
            Add 16 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^8
        IF x â‰¥ 2^8:
            Right-shift x by 8 bits
            Add 8 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^4
        IF x â‰¥ 2^4:
            Right-shift x by 4 bits
            Add 4 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^2
        IF x â‰¥ 2^2:
            Right-shift x by 2 bits
            Add 2 to msb

        # Check if x is at least 2^1
        IF x â‰¥ 2^1:
            Add 1 to msb

        Return msb

### ðŸ”Ž What This Does:

- This function **calculates the index of the most significant bit** (MSB) that is set to 1 in a 256-bit unsigned integer.
- It uses **binary search logic**â€”starting from the highest possible bit (128) and narrowing downâ€”making it **extremely efficient**.
- The approach is **gas-optimized**, avoiding loops by using conditionals and bit-shifting.
