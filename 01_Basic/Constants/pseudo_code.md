1. 🏗️ START constructing a digital building (smart contract) that holds permanent, unchangeable labels.

2. 🏷️ Name the building:
   DEFINE a contract called "Constants"
   // Think of this as a secure vault where fixed pieces of information are etched into stone.

   - 🔒 Inside the building, place two locked plaques (constant variables):

     a. DECLARE a public constant named "MY_ADDRESS"

     - SET its value to "0x777788889999AaAAbBbbCcccddDdeeeEfFFfCcCc"
       // Like engraving an owner's address on the wall—everyone can see it, but it’s set in stone and can’t be altered.

     b. DECLARE a public constant named "MY_UINT"

     - SET its value to 123
       // This is like placing a commemorative number (maybe a launch code or serial number) that never changes, visible to all visitors.

3. 🏁 END setup of the Constants building.
