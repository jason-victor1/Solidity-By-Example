// ðŸ§  Core Concept:
// In Ethereum, the base unit of currency is wei.
// Think of it like how cents relate to dollars â€” but on a much larger scale.

// 1 ether = 10^18 wei
// Ether is the standard, human-readable unit. Most people think in "ether".

// 1 gwei = 10^9 wei
// Gwei (giga wei) is commonly used for gas prices in transactions.

// 1 wei = the smallest denomination of ether
// This is like the "penny" in Ethereum â€” but WAY smaller.
// All values in Ethereum are ultimately measured in wei under the hood.
