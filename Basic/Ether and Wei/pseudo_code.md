1. 🏗️ START setting up a digital currency measurement booth (smart contract).

2. 🏷️ Name the booth:
   DEFINE a contract called "EtherUnits"
   // Think of this as a place that explains and verifies Ethereum’s unit system—like a crypto metric conversion center.

   a. 🪙 DECLARE a public label "oneWei" to represent the smallest Ethereum unit (1 wei)
   // Like pinning a tiny coin on the wall labeled "1 wei"

   b. ✅ DECLARE a public checklist item "isOneWei" that checks if "oneWei" really equals 1
   // Like asking: "Does this smallest coin really have a value of 1?" and showing a green check or red X

   c. 💰 DECLARE a public label "oneGwei" to represent 1 Gwei (1 billion wei)
   // Think of this as a larger coin labeled "1 Gwei" which is worth 1,000,000,000 wei

   d. ✅ DECLARE a public checklist item "isOneGwei" that confirms if "oneGwei" equals 1e9
   // Like a scale test: "Does this big coin actually weigh 1 billion wei?"

   e. 🏦 DECLARE a public label "oneEther" to represent the largest everyday Ethereum unit (1 Ether = 10^18 wei)
   // This is like placing a golden bar labeled “1 ETH” on display—equal to one quintillion wei

   f. ✅ DECLARE a public checklist item "isOneEther" that checks if "oneEther" equals 1e18
   // Another test station: “Does this giant gold bar weigh exactly 10^18 wei?”

3. 🏁 END the configuration of the EtherUnits booth.
