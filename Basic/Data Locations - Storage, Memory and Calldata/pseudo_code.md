1. Contract Name: DataLocations

2. State Variables:
    - arr: A dynamic array of integers, stored in persistent storage and accessible publicly.
    - map: A mapping that associates integers (keys) with addresses (values), stored in persistent storage.
    - myStructs: A mapping that associates integers (keys) with custom structs (MyStruct), stored in persistent storage.

3. Struct Definition:
    - MyStruct:
        - foo: An integer property of the struct.

4. Functions:

    4.1 Public Function `f`:
        INPUT: None
        ACTIONS:
            - Call an internal function `_f` and pass:
                - arr (storage array),
                - map (storage mapping),
                - myStructs[1] (a specific struct from the mapping in storage).
            - Access a struct `myStruct` from the `myStructs` mapping in storage.
            - Create a new instance of `MyStruct` in memory with `foo` initialized to 0.

    4.2 Internal Function `_f`:
        INPUT:
            - _arr: Reference to a storage array.
            - _map: Reference to a storage mapping.
            - _myStruct: Reference to a storage struct.
        ACTION: Perform operations on the passed storage references (details not provided).

    4.3 Public Function `g`:
        INPUT:
            - _arr: A dynamic array passed in memory (temporary, modifiable within the function).
        OUTPUT:
            - Returns a dynamic array from memory.
        ACTION: Perform operations on the input array and return a modified array.

    4.4 External Function `h`:
        INPUT:
            - _arr: A dynamic array passed in calldata (read-only and gas-efficient).
        ACTION: Perform operations on the input array without modifying it.

5. Key Concepts Demonstrated:
    - `storage`: Used for persistent variables (`arr`, `map`, and `myStructs`).
    - `memory`: Used for temporary, modifiable variables (`_arr` in `g` and `myMemStruct` in `f`).
    - `calldata`: Used for read-only, gas-efficient function inputs (`_arr` in `h`).
    - Visibility Modifiers:
        - `public`: Allows functions to be called internally or externally.
        - `external`: Allows functions to be called only from outside the contract.
        - `internal`: Allows functions to be called only within the contract or its derived contracts.
